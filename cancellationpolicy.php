<b><h3>1.Guest Service Fee:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Spaced Out charges Event Organizers a service fee for each transaction, in addition to any Space Provider service fee that Spaced Out may take from payments made for bookings. Please note that all bookings are subject to Spaced Out's Book Without Worry policy which provides a full refund for bookings cancelled within 24 hours of booking confirmation when booking is confirmed at least 72 hours prior to the originally scheduled event check-in.</p>
<b><h3>2.How to provide notification of cancellation:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">You must submit all cancellations through the Spaced Out platform. Your cancellation of a booked event is not effective unless and until you have requested the cancellation through your Spaced Out account.</p>
<b><h3>3.Cancellation Policy:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Spaced Out allows Space Provider to choose among three cancellation policies (each, a “Space Provider Cancellation Policy”):</p>
<b><h4>1.Flexible:</h4></b> Cancellations may be made by Event Organizer up to 2 business days prior to the Event Date. Space Provider shall refund the entire Usage Fee if cancellation is made by Event Organizer during the foregoing period, except for Spaced Out service fees, which are non-refundable; or</p>
<b><h4>2.Moderate:</h4></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Cancellations may be made by Event Organizer up to 5 calendar days prior to the Event Date. Space Provider shall refund the entire Usage Fee if cancellation is made by Event Organizer during the foregoing period, except for Spaced Out service fees, which are non-refundable; or</p>
<b><h4>3.Strict With Grace Period:</h4></b><p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;"> Cancellations may be made by Event Organizer up to 1 week prior to the Event Date. Space Provider shall refund the 50% of the Usage Fee if cancellation is made by Event Organizer during the foregoing period, except for Spaced Out service fees, which are non-refundable;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">EVENT ORGANIZER WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY REFUND IN RESPECT OF CANCELLATIONS MADE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHOSEN SPACE PROVIDER CANCELLATION POLICY.</p>
 
<b><u><h4>FOR CANCELLATION BY SPACE PROVIDER</h4></u></b>
 
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Space Provider may cancel a booking of its Space for an Event in accordance with the following terms:</p>
<b><h3>1.Service fee:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Spaced Out charges the Event Organizer a service fee for processing transaction, in addition to any service fee Spaced Out may take from payments made for bookings. The Spaced Out service fee is non-refundable.</p>
<b><h3>2.How to provide notification of cancellation:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">You must submit all cancellations through the Spaced Out platform. Your cancellation of a booked Event is not effective unless and until you have requested the cancellation through your Spaced Out account.</p>
<b><h3>3.Cancellation Fee:</h3></b><p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Space Provider who cancels a booking less than 30 days prior to the Event Date will be charged a $100 cancellation fee in addition to the amount of the service fee paid by the Event Organizer (which Spaced Out may refund to the Event Organizer in its discretion). Space Provider can only cancel any Event or booking once in any six month period. We will automatically deduct any applicable cancellation fee or service fee for which you are responsible, from the next payout.</p>
<b><h3>4.Unavailable/Blocked calendar:</h3></b> <p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Your calendar will stay blocked for the cancelled Event Date and you will not be able to accept another booking for the same dates of the canceled booking.</p>
 
<b><u><h4>EXCUSED CANCELLATIONS</h4></u></b>
 
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">Spaced Out may allow a Space Provider or an Event Organizer to cancel a Booking due to extenuating circumstances and with short notice (an “Excused Cancellation”).</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">In order to qualify a cancellation as an Excused Cancellation, the Space Provider or Event Organizer must submit the cancellation through its account on the Spaced Out platform, and, thereafter, email Spaced Out at info@Spaced Out.co to request that the cancellation be considered for Excused Cancellation. Spaced Out will evaluate the request and determine, in its sole judgment and discretion, whether or not the cancellation qualifies as an Excused Cancellation. In doing so, Spaced Out may require the Event Organizer or Space Provider to provide evidence to support the Excused Cancellation.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">If Spaced Out approves the Excused Cancellation, Fees will be refunded in full to the Event Organizer and no payout will be sent to the Space Provider; provided, however, that Spaced Out reserves the right to retain the service fee.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">The following circumstances may be considered grounds for an Excused Cancellation, subject to Spaced Out’s sole and exclusive discretion (the following list is non-exhaustive):</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•Unexpected death or serious illness of a Space Provider, Event Organizer, or immediate family member of either;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•Serious injury that directly restricts a Event Organizer’s ability to travel or a Space Provider’s ability to provide the Booked Space;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•A trigger of a state of emergency declared by an applicable governmental agency that directly impact use of a Space or the Event Organizer’s ability to travel to the Space;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•Urgent travel restrictions or severe security advisories issued after the time of Booking, by an appropriate government office or agency;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•Severe property damage or unforeseen maintenance issues that directly impact the safe use of the Space;</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana; text-align: left;">•Legal, municipality, or utility injunction or order that directly restricts use of or access to a Space; or</p>

 
<b><u><h4>SPACED OUT-INITIATED CANCELLATIONS</h4></u></b>

Except for cancellations due to Event Organizer malfeasance, as described below, when Spaced Out initiates a cancellation, all Fees will be refunded in full to the Event Organizer and no payout will be sent to the Space Provider; provided, however, that Spaced Out reserves the right to retain the service fee.
